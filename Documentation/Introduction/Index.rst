What does it do?
================

The extension provides a monthly booking calendar for hourly booking objects. You can just click 
on a day to get the day view for the bookings. New bookings are only possible if the time is in the future. 
If the booking icon is viewed, the FE user can insert some notes in the memo field and click the booking icon to book. 
If the FE user is looking for some partner for the booking he can check the partner wanted field.
